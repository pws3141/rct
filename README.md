# Risk Communication Tool

An interative tool to help clinicials and patients understand transplant outcomes. 
Uses fully synthetic data so please don't act upon anything in this tool! It is hosted on [Posit Connect](https://paulsmith-rct.share.connect.posit.cloud/).

If you actually require the proper risk communication tool, this is hosted on the [NHS ODT website](https://www.odt.nhs.uk/transplantation/tools-policies-and-guidance/risk-communication-tools/).
